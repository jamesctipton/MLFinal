    "Political rhetoric and discussions have seemingly become more polarized recently. In history and while reaching adulthood, being able to vote and be a part of politics is a very important role in a stable and healthy society. This project aims to use machine learning to develop a model to predict depression based on a string of text from twitter. Once this model is developed, it can be used to conduct an analysis on political messages sent online. We will be able to draw out patterns in twitter texts that the machine learning model classifies as showing signs of Depression. Another goal of this machine learning model is to extract patterns of text that can be connected to patterns of political messaging if they exist, and to compare this to a temporal aspect. With the changing view on polarized politics, it will be interesting to test if there is a change in the prevalence of messages classified with “depression” throughout different political times.\n"
